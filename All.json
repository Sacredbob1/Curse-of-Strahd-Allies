						"Zrin-Hala controls the surrounding air as an extension of itself. Each creature Zrin-Hala designates must succeed at a {@dc 24} Constitution saving throw or be hoisted or flung {@dice 3d6 × 10} feet through the air. A creature smashed into a solid object or released in mid-air takes {@damage 1d6} bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved or fallen.",
						"Zrin-Hala creates a torrent of debris within 120 feet of him that lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. The debris lightly obscures every creature and object in the area for the duration. All creatures in the area must succeed at a {@dc 24} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition blinded} until initiative count 20 on the next round."
